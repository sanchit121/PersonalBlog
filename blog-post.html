                    <blockquote>(An artist coworker of mine once asked whether alien life forms from Europa would be
                        called Europeans. The absence of any other plausible answer forced me to say
                        yes.)

                            <em>- Neil deGrasse Tyson</em>
                        </strong>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>There's almost no week without some kind of a discovery nowadays. Space, science, tech - you
                        name
                        it. But it's also true to some extent that it's not easy to understand all of the details,
                        because generally these are really technical and it's simply not possible to be acquainted
                        with
                        every branch of science, even when you're a scientist. And Tyson clearly understands that!
                        That's why this book contains knowledge in a form that's pleasant to any reader. There are
                        no
                        equations, algorithms, formulas. They seem to scare lot of people and his goal is different
                        - to
                        spread science.</p>
                    <p>I know there are many people that would love to understand space better, but they either
                        think
                        <i>it's too complicated or too time-consuming</i>. Worry no more, these 200 pages are all
                        you
                        need to
                        get a <u>grasp of the basics</u>, but not only. Tyson writes about gravity, space, time,
                        forces
                        and
                        many more. It's not too complicated, but please note that it's not the easiest book you'll
                        ever
                        read. It makes you think about life, cosmos, nature and other things - and that's super
                        cool,
                        but I'm not going to promise you won't need to use Google to understand some aspects of the
                        book. Or some concepts at least.
